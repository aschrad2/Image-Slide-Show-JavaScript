This example uses 3 HTML elements: <br>

2 button elements with ids of prev and next. These will be the buttons users click to navigate between images 
1 image element. This will display the current image <br>  <br>
We store all image paths in an array called images. <br>  <br>

We create a variable imageIndex to keep track of which image in the array we are currently displaying. <br>  <br>

We add a click event handler to each button that changes the image when the button is clicked. <br>  <br>

When the prev button is clicked, we decrement the image index. When the image index hits 0, we jump back up to the highest index. <br>  <br>

When the next button is clicked, we increment the image index. When the index hits the highest index, we jump back down to  <br>  <br>
